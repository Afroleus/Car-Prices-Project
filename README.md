Car Purchases 2003-2018

Objective: To view the price of used car prices from 2008 to 2017 for Europe

Data Used:
car_prediction_data.csv

Data Tidying:
-Prices need to be in the thousands for the graphs
-Euros need to be used (for both Selling Price and Present Price)
-Car Name needs a Manufacturer

Exploration:
-European car dataset used
- Selling Price to Present Price is an important connection
-Owner, Fuel Type not as important in comparison
- Transmision is though

Analysis:
- From 2008 to 2017, the average selling price of an automatic european car was only up to 20-40% of its value versus when it was purchased, indicating how much value was retained after mileage and depreciation. 2012 was the only year where you could get more than 40% of your value back of your vehicle, which started an upward trend from that year on. From 2008 to 2017, the Average and Median Km driven for those vehicles sold ultimately decreased. In 2012, even with more miles driven, the value retention of the vehicle stayed above 35%, and increased as the miles decrease year by year. Conversely from 2008 to 2017, after having a peak in 2010, the average selling price for a manual car started a lower downward trend after a plateau. This does not indicate mileage driven however, as the models present in the data are driven less than the automatics. Manuals driven from this dataset are driven less than half of the miles than the Automatics up until 2017, indicating a downward trend year by year. The Data suggests that as the years continue, the average depreciation of a automatic european car will be higher than a manual one, even with less miles driven from the manuals. Unfortunately, since the car models given do not have a manufacturer, and there is data missing in the outlier years omitted, only baseline predictions can be made until the data is updated.

Audience:
-Average TV News Watcher
-Automotive Company CEO
-Used Car Salesmen

Insights:
- manual vs auto per year 
- purchase price vs selling price (for that year) (x)
